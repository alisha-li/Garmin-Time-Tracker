# Garmin Time Tracker
Time tracking application for Garmin Watch, coded in Monkey C, which connects to Toggl Track. Built for Forerunner 245 Music, but can be altered for other watches as well. Watchface displays 12hr time, date, stopwatch, heartrate, calories, and current project indicator. App also incorporates module to store entries when not connected to wifi or bluetooth, autosyncing at every new time entry when connected again. Currently using to track my time 24/7/365. 

To use: set API token, workspace ids, and project ids, at the top of TimeTrackerDelegate. You can configure this to any projects you'd like (Toggl is intended for billable projects). My code sets the up button as work, down as athletics, back as leisure, and start as life. 

Utilized Garmin Forums (thank you FlowState and jim_m_58) for troubleshooting and understanding the structure of ConnectIQ apps.
